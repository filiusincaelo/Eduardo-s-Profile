# Projects

<p> In this section, you can find four projects that I consider relevant. These projects are either from university courses or personal projects Iâ€™ve worked on during my leisure time <p/>

```{note}
These projects took me from hours to a few days to reach their current stage. Therefore, you will find the name of each project, a description, and an image of what the project looked like. I keep the files, but you are more than welcome to read them, as you may find them useful

<h2> Automation for data analysis </h2>
<p> Who wouldn't love just to have their daily, weekly, monthly and yearly report done in few steps? This is one of the steps done for chart automation. With the single name of a document as csv file, it can read, storage and create pie charts. That program used around 22 helper functions following the DRY theory. Depending on the business other types of charts could be automated <p/>

<h2> Automation for documents generation </h2>
<p> since many years ago in the era of digitalization many websites automate the generation of documents as payment receipts, letters, emails, etc. This project with the objective of generating a word document
with the information of a customer <p/>

<h2> Prototyping a GPT </h2>
<p> This was the winner project in a class of entrepreuneurs at University Canada West, at that time I was the one coding and my team helped me with ideas and the presentation, yet I did adjust it even more and made some style improvements, it is a real Prototype of a GPT, it still works as a chatbot with predetermined responses, however to make a real GPT it will require more hours to learn and see potential ways of using Deep Learning and neural networks to make a real chatbot using Artificial Intelligence <p/>

<h2> Game Development using Godot Engine </h2>
<p> After completing tutorials in how to use the software and Gdscript, finally I was able to spend hours to make the basics of a game like the main menu and a transition, yet I reached the stage where I need to decide that to continue this project I will need to get my Art Assets from somewhere, this project is currently in pause <p/>
